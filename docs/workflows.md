Workflows in the ToolKit are run using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). The ToolKit incorporates the Nextflow executable and runs the provided workflow internally. Nextflow only requires Java version 8 or later and is extremely flexible across different compute environments. By default all workflows are designed to work with either Docker or Singularity locally or in the cloud using AWS. If you would like to add an additional environment contact the tool's creator.
